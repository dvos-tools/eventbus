## ðŸš€ Quick Start

If you're in a hurry, here's the absolute minimum to get started:

```csharp
using com.DvosTools.bus;

// 1. Define an event
public class PlayerDiedEvent
{
    public string PlayerName { get; set; }
    public int Score { get; set; }
}

// 2. Subscribe to it
EventBus.RegisterUnityHandler<PlayerDiedEvent>(OnPlayerDied);

// 3. Handle the event
void OnPlayerDied(PlayerDiedEvent evt)
{
    Debug.Log($"Player {evt.PlayerName} died with score {evt.Score}");
}

// 4. Send the event
EventBus.Send(new PlayerDiedEvent { PlayerName = "Player1", Score = 1000 });
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

By the end of this documentation, you'll know how to:

- âœ… Set up event-driven architecture in Unity
- âœ… Handle threading safely with UnityDispatcher
- âœ… Route events to specific game objects and systems
- âœ… Buffer events until objects are ready to process them
- âœ… Handle high-frequency event processing
- âœ… Debug and troubleshoot event systems
- âœ… Apply professional patterns and best practices

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Basic C# knowledge
- Unity 2020.3 or later
- Understanding of Unity's component system

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Add to your `Packages/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.dvos-tools.bus": "file:../path/to/unitybus"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ¤” Why Use Unity EventBus?

- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate without direct references
- **Thread Safety**: Built-in UnityDispatcher prevents Unity threading issues
- **Efficiency**: Designed for high-frequency event processing
- **Unity Integration**: Designed specifically for Unity's architecture
- **Simple API**: Easy to use with comprehensive documentation
